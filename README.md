# CityWeatherApp
A simple Javascript and PHP-based weather app using Accuweather APIs and ChartJS

The app was built as part of my experimentation with Modern JavaScript. I make API calls through a back-end script written in PHP, which is being used as middleware. If you are learning Javascript and the basics of consuming APIs, this project could be a great start. Fork it or clone it to get started. You can also improve this app further. Maybe a great place to practice your GitHub skills.

## Tech Stack
_Front-end_: of course HTML5, CSS (Wrapped in Bootstrap 5) and Modern Javascript. For experimentation, I have also included ChartJs and Date-Fns libraries.

_Back-end_: I am hosting this app on shared hosting server where only PHP scripting is supported. So, I had no options than using PHP script for API calls. I intentionally avoided keeping sensitive information on the client-side. So, in the back-end, it is a MySQL, PHP and Apache. 

_API Data_: A free account with Accuweather API

One of the challenges I faced was managing number of API calls with free account. So, I programmed the App to make API calls to Accuweather cautiously to maintain low call volume.

##Features
Nothing fancy. It is still a basic app. You may still call it as a crap:). I want you to use it as a base in your projects.

```
2. Change the directory

cd City-Weather-App
```

3. Run node package manager command to install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```
4. Rename config file from `config_example.php` to `config.php`

5. Visit [Accuweather API](https://developer.accuweather.com/apis) and create an account to get your API KEY. Once you sign in your account, you will have to _Add a Project_ to get your API KEY. 

6. Open up config.php in your favorite code editor and replace the key string with your key.

7. Now run the below command to build your app.

```bash
npm run build
```

8. All the build files are moved to a `dist` folder. Start your local PHP supported server such as Xampp, Wamp, Lamp or Mamp. I used Xampp. `Visit http://localhost:[port]/[path to the folder] to view the app.
